# Ultimate post on Coronavirus for @opendatascience telegram channel 

Dear readers and subscribers, we would have ignored coronavirus theme completely, wasn't it for 64% of you who asked for at least some information to be posted.

So we came up with rather big and thorouful post, available as a GitHub page, so you can submit your pull requests with updates / additions to the information provided.

We followed some rules, which we find adequate and which are based on the common sense and hope that all the contributors will comply with them:

1. Provided information should be correct, better if it is verifiable.
2. Source should be provided not to spread fake news data.
3. Biases and distributions should be taken into account: raw information is not that representative and can misguide opinions.
4. If appliable, information should be actionable â€” readers should get a clear picture of what they can do after reading it, not just get upset or worried.
